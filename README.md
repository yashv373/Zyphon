# 📡 Zyphon: From Ohm’s Law to GDSII - The Open-Source Chip Design Education Revolution.

Welcome to **Zyphon**, an **open-source, structured, and intuitive** platform to learn **everything** about VLSI, from the **grain of sand used to make silicon** to **a chip!** Zyphon tackles resource scarcity and the lack of a centralized database, making VLSI knowledge accessible to thousands of students worldwide. No paywalls, no gatekeeping—Zyphon is free and built by the community, for the community. 🚀

## 🔥 Why Zyphon?
```
✅ Structured learning: From basic physics to full-chip design.  
✅ Hands-on simulations: Open-source EDA tools, in-browser HDL coding.  
✅ Leetcode-style HDL challenges: (Coming soon 🚧, read more in `12_Zyphon’s_Future`). 
✅ Free & Open-source: No paywalls, no BS. Only knowledge.  
✅ Community-driven: Built for engineers, by engineers.  
```
Why Does VLSI Have Such a High Entry Barrier?
```
🔴 Scattered Knowledge – No structured roadmap; beginners are left to figure things out.
🔴 Limited Access to Industry-Grade Tools – Proprietary software makes hands-on learning difficult.
🔴 High Learning Curve – From physics to HDL coding, the sheer depth of VLSI can be overwhelming.
🔴 Academic Siloing – University courses barely scratch the surface of real-world chip design.
🔴 Lack of Community Support – Unlike software engineering, VLSI lacks an easy-to-access support network.
```
🔥 Zyphon is designed to eliminate these barriers.

📢 Who is Zyphon for?
1. Complete Beginners – If you're new to VLSI, start from 1_Silicon_Level and follow the structured path.
2. Students & Self-Learners – Learn CMOS, FPGA, Physical Design, STA, and more in one place.
3. Aspiring Chip Designers, Career Transitioners – Get hands-on with HDL coding, EDA tools, and industry-level projects.
4. Job Seekers – Use `10_Extras` for interview prep, industry insights, and real-world projects.

P.S.
The Name? - We used Yashvardhan's signature 'Z' prefix for his project names and combined it with 'Phonon'(which refers to the quantum mechanical vibrations in semiconductors). Tweaking it for readability, we decided on Zyphon.

Let’s **revolutionize VLSI education together!** 💥
