//we will begin learning verilog using practical methodology.
// all of the codes here on out will be heavily commented to explain the process and logic.
//we will begin from the basics and move upto complex circuits
//for a structure bottom-up approach, we're following the list by HDLbits.
//The first task is to describe a verilog circuit with no inputs and 1 output.
