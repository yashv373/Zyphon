This folder contains learning Zyphon resources for Verilog HDL - Hardware description language.
Currently, this focuses on providing solutions for HDLbits, a brilliant website to learn verilog iteratively.
We highly recommend checking it out!
any files with `H0` at the start is a HDLbit based example, and you can open and view them, ordered as per the website number.
instead of viewing everything in preview, view it as "code" in github, so as to have clear line by line distinctions.

Happy learning.
